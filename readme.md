Hey! 

Thanks for showing interest in joining the 1ounce frontend development team. We will be giving you guys a mini-techincal practice. We want you to use your creativity to design and create a simple mobile application for us.

Prompt: Create a simple recipe application, that shows the customer the different kinds of recipe, and a personal account page. All designs are up to you to design, and create.

Here are some of the instruction:

1. Create a simple application with 3 navigational screens
- First screen: HomePage
- Second screen: A specific Recipe Page
- Third screen: Personal Account page

2. User Flow/User Story
- When I first go on the application, I should see the homepage, with the different recipe (you could make it scrollable) or have different sub sections on the page
- When I click on one of the recipe on the homepage, it should take me to their individual recipe page (passing data in between screens)
- Meanwhile, the navigation bar at the bottom should always be at the bottom
- When I click on the personal acccount page icon, it should take me to my personal account page
